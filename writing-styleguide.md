# Writing Styleguide

For the sake of consistency, rules of style are defined herein.

## Titles

### Past tense

- Good: Sally attacked Fred
- Bad: Sally attacks Fred

### Third person

- Good: The Zombie attacked Sally!
- Bad: The Zombie attacks you!

## Decorated Names

Names can be shown with decorations, or without.

```ts
monster.name // Sally
decoratedName(monster) // Sally the Zombie
```

Character names should always be decorated.

Monster names should be decorated in titles, but may be undecorated for brevity in bodies and descriptions.
